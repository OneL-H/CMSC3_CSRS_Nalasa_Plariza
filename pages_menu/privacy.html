            <h1>UNIVERSITY OF THE PHILIPPINES (UP) PRIVACY NOTICE FOR STUDENTS</h1>
            <h3>(REVISED AS OF THE 1ST SEMESTER/TRIMESTER 2019-2020)</h3>

            <div>
                <h1>POLICY</h1>
                <p>To exercise and safeguard academic freedom and uphold your right to quality education, the University of the Philippines needs to process your personal and sensitive personal information - that is, information that identifies you as an individual.

                    <br><br>UP is committed to comply with the <a href="https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/2012/08/15/republic-act-no-10173/">Philippine Data Privacy Act of 2012 (DPA)</a> in order to protect your right to data privacy.
                    
                    <br><br>This notice explains in general terms the purpose and legal basis for the processing of the typical or usual examples of personal and sensitive personal information that UP collects from students like you, the measures in place to protect your data privacy and the rights that you may exercise in relation to such information. Please note that this document does not contain an exhaustive list of all of UP's processing systems as well as the purpose and legal basis for processing.
                    
                    <br><br>Under the DPA, personal information may be processed (e.g. collected, used, stored, disclosed, etc.) with the consent of the data subject, pursuant to a contract with the data subject; when it is necessary in order for UP to comply with a legal obligation; to protect your vitally important interests including life and health; respond to a national emergency, public order, and safety; fulfill the functions of public authority or pursuant to the legitimate interests of the University or a third party; except where such interests are overridden by your fundamental rights.
                    
                    <br><br>Sensitive personal information (e.g. confidential educational records, age/birthdate, civil status, health, religious affiliation etc.) on the other hand may be processed with the consent of the data subject, when such is allowed by laws and regulations, such regulatory enactments provide for the protection of such information, and the consent of the data subject is not required for such law or regulation. For example, under the Education Act of 1982, parents have the right to access the educational records of children who are under their parental responsibility. Processing may also be done when needed to protect the life and health of the data subject or another person, and the data subject is unable to legally or physically express consent; in the case of medical treatment; or needed for the protection of lawful rights and interests of natural or legal persons in court proceedings; and for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims; or where provided to government or public authority.
                    
                    <br><br>The term <em>UP/University/us</em> refers to the University of the Philippines System and Constituent University (CU) offices.
                    
                    <br><br>The term <em>you/your</em> refers to all students of the University of the Philippines System, as well as those seeking to be admitted to the University (except for those seeking admission through the UPCAT who are covered by the UP Privacy Notice for UPCAT applicants) and, where the context so indicates, in the case of minors, their parents or guardians who also sign registration related and other forms that students fill out, such as leave of absence and scholarship application forms.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h1>PERSONAL AND SENSITIVE PERSONAL INFORMATION COLLECTED FROM STUDENTS, AND THE PURPOSE/S AND LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING SUCH INFORMATION</h1>
                <p>Various UP offices collect your personal information through paper based and online processing systems. UP may likewise collect publicly available information about you. Some application forms require you to provide a photograph. In some instances, your image is captured by UP's closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras, or when UP documents, records, broadcasts (including live streaming), or publishes University activities or events.

                    <br><br>When you applied for admission to UP you provided us, through the forms you submitted and signed (and in the case of minors that your parents/guardians also signed), among others, your name, sex assigned at birth, date and place of birth, civil status, citizenship, your photograph, information about your family (names of your parents, their citizenship, civil status ), your signature and other personal information that we use, along with other documents you provide us (e.g. information contained in educational records) to be able to verify your identity in the course of determining your eligibility to enroll in UP. We required you to attest that the information that you provided us is true and correct as we also use the information in order to prevent the commission of fraud. Such processing is necessary for compliance with our legal obligation as a publicly funded University and to uphold our legitimate interest as an educational institution as well as that of taxpayers. When you provide UP with the personal and sensitive personal information of third parties you warrant that you have obtained their consent for UP to process their information.
                    
                    <br><br>In the case of students who were admitted through the UPCAT, you also provided the highest educational attainment and occupation of your parents as well as your family's annual household income. UP processed that information along with your permanent address and other information (e.g. grades) as the selection of campus qualifiers also considers socioeconomic and geographic factors as explained in the UPCAT Bulletin. Such processing is pursuant to Section 9 of RA 9500 which requires UP to take affirmative steps to enhance the access of disadvantaged students to the University's programs and services.
                    
                    <br><br>Non-Filipino citizens seeking admission to the University are required to provide personal and sensitive personal information in order for UP to ascertain that their admission and enrollment is allowed under applicable Philippine laws, rules and regulations, and University rules and procedures.
                    
                    <br><br>In order for UP to exercise its right to academic freedom and to uphold academic standards under its Charter it processes the educational records and other personal information provided by prospective students to determine their eligibility to enroll.
                    
                    <br><br>UP processes your personal and sensitive personal information, in the course of fulfilling its obligation, to provide you quality education by exercising its right to academic freedom, and upholding academic standards, when the University's duly authorized personnel process your enrollment; evaluate the work that you submit in fulfillment of your academic requirements and give you grades; act on your applications for change of matriculation, dropping, leave of absence and the like; determine your academic progress and compliance with the University's retention and other rules; evaluate and recommend you for graduation; act on appeals on such matters; and, in the event you are qualified under the rules, recommend that you be awarded honors upon your graduation.
                    
                    <br><br>Aside from sensitive personal information in the form of grades, you also provide UP with health information as part of the admission and registration processes so that the University may determine your physical fitness to enroll; and be able to provide you with the proper care when you avail of UP's health services; or in case of an emergency; or in compliance with University rules that are meant to uphold academic standards (e.g., submission of medical certificates in order for your absences to be excused, for you to drop a subject, go on leave of absence, or justify underloading in an appeal to graduate with honors, etc.).
                    
                    <br><br>UP processes information regarding your religious affiliation in the course of verifying your identity (e.g. offices match information in your birth certificate and school records provided to us etc.) to conduct research to see to it that we uphold the principle of democratic access; and that, as a non-sectarian institution, we do not discriminate on the basis of religious creed; and to uphold your right to freedom of religion(e.g. by providing you with services that are consistent with your beliefs in relation to your health needs and food preparation, etc.).
                    
                    <br><br>The University may process your personal and sensitive personal information in order to compile statistics and conduct research, subject to the provisions of the DPA and applicable research ethics guidelines, in order to carry out its mandate as the National University.
                    
                    <br><br>Contact information is processed by UP in order to be able to communicate effectively with you, and to enable us to contact your family or other people you identify, in the case of an emergency. For example, UP offices or your teachers may use the information generated by the applicable registration system in order to contact you via email or via a messaging system for class related and other academic matters, as well as UP related activities and information. UP may also contact you in order to solicit your consent to participate in academic or non-commercial research.
                    
                    <br><br>In some instances, because UP is aware that not all students have access to the Internet at all times, or that you may have failed to update email or contact details, UP may inform you of the need to contact certain UP offices, or to submit certain requirements by a certain date, or otherwise disseminate information that you need to know by posting your name or other relevant personal information on UP bulletin boards. In the case of email correspondence, your email address may be disclosed to other members of the class so that other students to whom you may have disclosed your new email address, or other contact details, will be able to relay email messages to you.
                    
                    <br><br>UP processes personal and sensitive personal information, and, in particular, financial information related to your studies, in order to administer State-funded and privately financed scholarships, as well as grants or other forms of assistance, pursuant to its contractual or legal obligations as part of the University's legitimate interests and that of taxpayers, as well as relevant third parties, such as donors or sponsors.
                    
                    <br><br>Your personal and sensitive personal information may also be processed in order for UP to provide you with services, such as the issuance of your ID card, stickers or gate passes, library, dormitory, health , counseling and guidance services and the like; facilitate the processing of applications for insurance and insurance claims; determine whether the student organization or association to which you belong may be recognized and given access to University services, etc., to enable your participation in student elections, exchange programs, internships, training programs, conferences, etc.; administer scholarships, grants and other forms of assistance, pursuant to UP's contractual or legal obligations; or to protect your vitally important interests.
                    
                    <br><br>CCTVs and other security measures which may involve the processing of your personal information are intended to protect your vitally important interests, for public order and safety, and pursuant to the University's and the public's legitimate interests. UP processes personal and sensitive personal information in order to comply with its duty as an academic institution to exercise due diligence to prevent harm or injury to you or others.
                    
                    <br><br>You may also be required to present your UP ID when you avail of University services, or when you request documents containing your personal and sensitive personal information. If you request such information through a representative, UP will require that you provide a letter of authorization specifying the information or document requested, the purpose(s) for which the same will be used, and the presentation of your UP ID or other valid government-issued identification card (GIID), as well the GIID of your duly authorized representative, in order for UP to see to it that fraud is prevented, and your right to data privacy is upheld.
                    
                    <br><br>UP will process your name, student number and photograph in order to issue your UP radio-frequency enabled identification (RFID). A unique, randomly generated number, as well as your student number, will be encoded in the RFID tag or chip of your UP ID such that these will be the only information that can be read by a compatible RFID reader.
                    
                    <br><br>UP, using its RFID readers, will process the abovementioned information when you tap or wave your UP ID card in close proximity to such readers in order to:
                
                    <br><br>
                </p>

                <ol type="1">
                    <li>regulate access to libraries and other University buildings in order to supplement other existing security measures in place;</li>
                    <li>provide you with RFID enabled services in UP offices where these are applicable or available; and</li>
                    <li>provide benefits to qualified students pursuant to the UP Charter and relevant internal rules.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    <br>UP has a legitimate interest in securing the UP community, its buildings and other assets and adopting means in order to provide services in a more efficient manner.

UP has adopted appropriate measures to safeguard your right to data privacy over your abovementioned information.
                    
                    <br><br>The University provides for the secure processing and, when applicable, secure archival of the educational record and other relevant personal information of its students that are needed to verify their identity so that UP will be able to provide the proper transcripts, certifications, and other documents that current or former students or alumni may request as required by the Education Act of 1982, and comply with obligations to the UP Alumni Association under the UP Charter and University rules, as well as for historical and research purposes as permitted by law.
