                <h4>PROGRAM PROFILE</h4>

                <br>The Department of Biological Sciences and Environmental Studies (BSES) offers a 4-year BS Biology
                degree program with two major fields of specialization to choose from, Ecology and Cell Biology. Areas
                of study in Ecology include life forms in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. The Cell Biology division
                has recently been expanded to include not only studies of life forms at cellular level, but also
                molecular studies of plant, animal and microbial life forms.

                The BS Biology curriculum also includes the conduct of an undergraduate thesis which provides the
                students the opportunity to perform research work along their chosen field of specialization under the
                guidance of their selected faculty adviser.

                <br><br>
                <h4>JOB OPPORTUNITIES</h4>
                <br>Students may proceed to pursue a medical degree after graduation. Other graduates may pursue careers
                in either government and private institutions as teachers or researchers, or in government organizations
                engaged in biological conservation and/or advocacy activities.

            <div>
                <h4>PROGRAM PROFILE</h4>
                The program is based primarily on the needs of Mindanao, particularly in pursuing the island’s role
                as the country’s food basket amidst the challenges of globalization and
                international competitiveness. The program is
                unique as no other university in the region offers a degree in economics that is
                geared towards applying economic theories in agribusiness. The program will
                develop graduates with strong theoretical and mathematical foundations necessary
                for the application of concepts in real problems of the region.

                <h4>JOB OPPORTUNITIES</h4>
                Graduates of this program will be employed in decision-making positions in agribusiness input
                suppliers, marketing firms, public and private organizations providing services
                to farms, the agribusiness sector and the rural sector. They can also be engaged
                in research and the teaching profession.

            <h3>Master in Management</h3>
            <div>
                <p>
                    Today’s world of work is more complex and volatile than it was years back. Managerial problems,
                    especially those faced by decision-makers at the highest levels of administration, have become less
                    structured than they were in the past. Increasingly, managers have to deal with more sophisticated
                    technologies, more rapidly expanding and contracting markets. In adapting to these changes,
                    organizations have become flatter, smaller and more flexible in structure, more integrative in
                    approach to decision-making, and more global in operation.

                    <br><br>Given the dynamism of our present work environment, it becomes imperative for organizational
                    leaders
                    to develop the capability to assess a broad spectrum of interrelated issues and to interpret a
                    continuous stream of data that are vital to decision-making.

                    <br><br>Decision-makers ought to be humanistic because people are the carriers of today’s most
                    important
                    resources (knowledge and information), and holistic because managerial problems and issues are
                    interrelated.

                    <br><br>
                <h4>GENERAL OBJECTIVES</h4>

                <br>The program aims to hone the following managerial skills and competences:
                <br>* Human skills – ability to lead and motivate
                <br>* Analytical skills – ability to discern relationships, detect dysfunction, identity and evaluate
                options
                <br>* Integrative skills– ability to perceive the whole picture and latticework of interdependencies
                <br>* Innovativeness – ability to develop approaches in applying new and continually evolving stock of
                knowledge and information
                <br>* Proactiveness – the ability to anticipate problems and issues to set the tone for change and
                develop orientation or concern for the enhancement of the human condition in the long run

                <br><br>
                <h4>ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS</h4>

                <br>1. A bachelor’s degree in any field of study
                <br>2. A minimum of 2.5 or equivalent average grade
